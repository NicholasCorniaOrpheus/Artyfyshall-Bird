# Guidelines

Campion's algorithm requires a bassus melody and the disposition of the other voices (tenor, altus and cantus) on the initial note of the bass.

1. Record the bassus melody on the ``./bassus_melody.ly`` file. Write down only absolute pitches without duration according to the Lilypond syntax.
2. Run the ``../campion-1618.py`` code and input the initial contapuctal configuration of the tenor, altus and cantus.
3. The resulting .ly file is available at ``./output``

You can compile the Lilypond file to generate a PDF and MIDI representation.
